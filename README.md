# Apartment Scraper

Using BeautifulSoup4 we will scrape craigslist for apartments that match our preferences. 

The goal is to create a database of potential apartments that can be explored through Streamlit.

On Streamlit we will use OpenStreetMap API to interact with the selection of apartments.

On the Analysis Page users can filter for their selection and explore visualizations based on location and bedrooms.

On the Visualize Map page, the listings are plotted on a map and users can hover over each listing to see more detail.

If the user is interested in a listing, they can enter the ID shown in the tooltip for all the details of that listing.
